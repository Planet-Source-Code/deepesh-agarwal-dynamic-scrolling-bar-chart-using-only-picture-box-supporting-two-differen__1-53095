Note: you can use the three different images provided, if you want to resize the box , if you want to make picture box bigger use any picture and make a new one according to your size needed.

This demo will let you display dynamic bar chart using two different styles, one static and other scrolling using only picture box,i searched many sites and codes for this functionality but can't get what i was looking for , the only solution i got used Microsofts MSchart Activex control but it was around "1 mb" more then my app.  itself (if filesize is not a concern to u then it is the most flexible), so here it is a bar chart display using only picture box, pls. do vote if you liked it. also, don't forget to visit my website http://www.deepeshagarwal.tk for lots of free software's.
